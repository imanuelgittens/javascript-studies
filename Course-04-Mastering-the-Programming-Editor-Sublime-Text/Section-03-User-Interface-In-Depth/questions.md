####Question 2

Describe the function and purpose of Package Control.

Package Control is the functionality that Sublime Text provides to its users so that they can interact with packages. These packages can be thought of as plugins and they can add new functionality to Sublime Text or enhance its existing functionality. Users interact with these packages through a program called the Package Control Manager. 

All Sublime Text packages can be found [here](https://packagecontrol.io/) as well as documentation on how to install and use them. Some of the ways in which users interact with packages include -

- Enable Package
- Install Package
- List Packages
- Remove Package
- Update Package
- Create Package File

Package Control is fundamental to giving users of Sublime Text the ability to customize their workflows and experiences while using the editor.

####Question 3

Explain the function of Sublime Text's command palette and describe how to open it. Give detailed descriptions (include screenshots) of how to use the command palette.

Sublime Text's command palette allows for quick access to commands. It is accessed by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac. After pressing this sequence a list of commands are shown with an input box for filtration.

We can take a look at how this Command Palette works by using the **Set Syntax: HTML** command. Lets start off by creating a new file with some HTML.

Typing the HTML like this is quite cumbersome and we suddenly remember that Sublime Text has syntax functionality to help us out when we write HTML. To enable it we need to access the Command Palette and find this command. We press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for the command.

After we find the command we want to execute, we simply hit **Enter**. After pressing Enter, the syntax of our document will be updated and also the auto-complete feature for HTML will be activated.

This is just one example of using the command palette however there are many commands that can be run this way. You are encouraged to test them out for yourself to get a better idea of how they all work.

####Question 4 

Describe the function of Sublime Text "quick lists" (include a screenshot).

Quick Lists in Sublime text show all the related options for a particular command. We can use the `Package Control: Install Package` command as an example.

After pressing **Enter** a Quick List of all the packages available for install are shown.

And that's it! Quick Lists are used simply to show additional options that are related to a command.

####Question 5

Describe 'full-screen mode' and give instruction about how to enable and disable it.

Full screen mode in Sublime Text makes the program take up the entire screen and can be activated by pressing `F11` on Windows or `Cmd + Ctrl + F` on Mac. It doesn't add or remove any functionality from the editor but may help to minimize distractions from other things happening on the computer screen like notifications, messages etc.
