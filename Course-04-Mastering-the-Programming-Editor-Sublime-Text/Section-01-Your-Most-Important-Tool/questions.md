#### Question 1

Title: Sublime Text Innovations

Category: Why You Need Sublime Text

Sublime Text is one of the best text editors for writing code, markup and prose. Its users enjoy a simple, aesthetic interface that packs extraordinary features and amazing performance under the hood. Sublime text stands out among other text editors because of these extrardinary features - features that this editor can boast of being the first to implement. Some of these features include:

- Multiple selections - This allows you to edit different parts of text at the same time.
- Goto Anything interface - This allows you to open files, jump to symbols, lines and words with only a few keystrokes.
- Command Palette - This simplifies access to common commands.

Sublime Text joins these innovations with a host of other design and functionality choices that truly make it one of the best text editors around. If you're looking to start programming and you aren't sure which editor to use, be sure to give Sublime Text a test run and see for yourself. 

Happy coding!

#### Question 2

Title: Text Editors in Programming

Category: Why You Need Sublime Text

As a programmer, you need a tool to get your job done, and that tool, is your editor. Your choice of editors can directly affect your experiences, workflows and capabilities therefore choosing a good one is very important. Programming editors come in the form of both IDEs (integrated Development Environments) and Text Editors but this article will pay particular attention to the Text Editor and describe its importance to programming. 

Text editors are simple tools for writing code and they provide minimal features out of the box. Let's see what advantages this minimalistic approach to a programming tool provides:

- Developers can create their own workflows: This allows for preference and innovation in the way things are done.
- Developers must understand how things are done: Text Editors don't abstract any process or step from the developer. This forces them to learn exactly how things are done and how they work.
- Functionality can be added or removed: Good Text Editors allow for functions to be added/removed via custom programming or plugin. The ability to customize the workspace like this gives developers the functionality they need to program quickly and efficiently.  

Even though the do-it-yourself approach that Text Editors take can make them harder to work with initially, they are certainly worth considering if you truly want to master the craft of development.

#### Question 3

Advantages and disadvantages of using an IDE

Text editors as well as IDEs(Integrated Development Environments) are both capable tools for Web development. When deciding with one to choose however, it is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of both so that an informed decision can be made. This article will take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of an IDE so that you can compare them to a Text Editor.

Let's first take a look at some of the reasons why you would want to use an IDE i.e. the advantages -

- They require less time and effort: IDEs usually come bundled with a multitude of tools designed to help minimize/fix mistakes, help with tasks and the organization of resources.
- They provide a lot of functionality out of the box: IDEs come with a ton of features by default. If these featured are required with a text editor for example, the user would have to install plugins(if they are available) and configure their environment themselves. This can be simple or very complex depending on the functionality required. 
- Support multiple programming languages: Most IDEs include integrations for many programming languages, technologies and tools. 


Let's now look at some of the reasons you wouldn't want to use an IDE i.e. the disadvantages -

- They are resource intensive: IDEs usually have a ton of features and for all these features to run properly, the IDE must consume a lot of your computer's memory.
- They abstract many layers away from the user: Since the IDE performs so many tasks automatically, it will be hard for the user to know exactly what is going on. Should something go wrong, it will be difficult to troubleshoot.
- High learning curve: IDEs are usually very complicated tools. While getting started with an IDE is quite easy, truly mastering it will require a lot of time and effort. 

Hopefully this gives you a bit more knowledge about IDEs and what to expect when using them. While there is no right or wrong choice, it is important that you to take these factors into consideration when choosing your tool for programming.
