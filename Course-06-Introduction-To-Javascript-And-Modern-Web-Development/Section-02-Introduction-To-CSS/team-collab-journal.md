My partner for this project was Joshua Sadlon and together we basically finished the collaboration app in about two days. We were both restricted by our jobs and could only work for about 2 hours on evenings. (I managed to squeeze in some extra time on mornings because I wake very early). It was also good that we were in the same time zone. 

We decided to split up the work into pieces so he took on the header and chat area (say-something) and I took on the main content area. After we were both finished writing the HTML and CSS for our respective sections, we reviewed each others sections to fix any errors and to optimize each other's code. 

The rest of the time was spent doing the questions for the second Team Project and figuring out how to use Github Pages. He took questions 2,4 and 6 while I tackled 1, 3 and 5. This was  done in a day and we were ready to submit.

The overall expereince of working with Joshua was very pleasing. He knew his stuff so there was no need for any handing holding. He communicated with me every day to ensure that everything was on track. I also learned that we both had to leave our day jobs to cook on evenings! What a life. 

Awesome stuff all around.
