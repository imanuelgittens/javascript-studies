####Exercise 1

**Question 1**

Prime Facotrization of 121 = 11 x 11
Prime Facotrization of 1000 = 2 x 5 x 5 x 2 x 5 x 2
Prime Facotrization of 2525 = 5 x 5 x 101

**Question 2**

91 is divisible by 7 if there exists an integer (x) such that 7x = 91. 

	7 * 13 = 91 
So this means that 91 is divisible by 7. 

**Question 3**

-1331 is divisble by 11 is there exists an integer (x) such that 11x = -1331.

	11 * (-121) = -1331

Since negative numbers are also integers, -1331 is divisible by 11.

####Exercise 2

**Question 1**

11231 = 31 x 362 + 9

**Question 2**

a = 324 b = 192

tmp = 324%192
tmp = 132

a = 192 b = 132

tmp = 192 % 132
tmp = 60

a = 132 b = 60

tmp = 132 % 60
tmp = 12

a = 60 b = 12

tmp = 60%12
tmp = 0

a = 12 b = 0

GCD = 12

**Question 3**

Prime factors of 48 are 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2
Prime factors of 72 are 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 3

The common factors are 2 and 3 so the GCD is 2 * 3 = 6
