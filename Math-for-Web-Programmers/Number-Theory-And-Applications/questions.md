**Question 1**
The properties of a hash functions include -
- they are injective which means that for any input there exists at most one output
- they are very fast
- they are extrememly hard to reverse
- it is very hard to find collisions

**Question 2**

**Question 3**

The answer is yes.

If $a$ divides $b$ there exists a number x such that $ax$ = $b$
Example a = 5 and b = 15
a x 3 = 15

For $a$ to divide $-b$ there must exist an x such that $ax$ = $b$
Using the above values we can see that 
a x (-3) = -15

**Question 4**
If $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $a$ then $a$ and $b$ are equal. 

**Question 5**
If the game only involved Rock-Paper-Scissors the modular arithmetic would change to (b-a) mod 3.

**Question 6**

The prime factorization of 2048 is

2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

**Question 7**

Example 1
Let $a$ = 5 and $b$ = 15
The LCM here is 15
The GCD here is 5

Example 2
Let $a$ = 18 amd $b$ = 27
The LCM here is 54
The GCD here is 9

The relationship between LCM and GCD is 

$a$ x $b$ = GCD($a$, $b$) x LCM($a$, $b$)

This is seen in example 2 where 18 x 27 = 54 x 9
