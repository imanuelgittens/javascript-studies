**Question 1**

Assume we have a function that maps elements fromt the set X to the set Y

f : X --> Y

The function will be surjective if and only if for y elements in Y there exists at least one x element in X such that f(x) = y. It also implies that there can be more than one x such that f(x) = y. With surjective functions the range of f will be equal to its co-domain. 

**Example** - f(x) = x^3

The function will be injective if and only if for y elements in Y there exists at most one x element in X such that f(x) = y. It also implies that there can be an element in Y that does not have a corresponding x such that f(x) = y. 

**Example** 

f: R --> R

f(x) = x + 2


**Question 2**

On a circular table, we must first fix the position for the first person. There is only one way for the first person to sit since the seats are identical (there is no start or end when the seats are empty). Once the first person is seated however, other persons can sit to their right or their left. 

This means that if we have 10 people, we must place the first one at a table then place the other 9. Mathematically this can be represented as:

	1 * 9!

So there are 9! ways to place 10 people around a circular table. 

**Question 3**

We can arrange 5 men in 5! ways.
We can arrange 5 women in 5! ways.

We can start with either a boy first or a girl first there our final answer is 

	2 * 5! * 5!


**Question 4**

5 Choir members singing base and we need one so:

	C(5,1)

10 Choir member sing tenor and we need two so:

	C(10,2)

10 choir member sing soprano and we need one so:

	C(10,1)


We find the sum of all choice for the final result:

	C(5,1) + C(10,2) + C(10,1)


**Question 5**

Since we cannot distinguish between right and left socks and we are choosing three socks, we end up with the following combinations (W - white and B - black):

WWW
WWB
WBW
WBB
BWW
BWB
BBW
BBB

This means that your friend was correct and choosing three socks will always give you either a white or black pair.

**Question 6**

Adding numbers

Even + Even = even

Odd + Odd = even

Even + Odd = odd

This means that someone must pick at least three random numbers so that the sum of any two will be even.
