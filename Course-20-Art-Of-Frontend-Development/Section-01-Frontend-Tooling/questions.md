#####Explain how to set up and run a grunt task using a third party plugin. Give an example of how to do this with at least one third party plugin (don't use the plugin used in the chapter; 'uglify').

Setting up tasks in grunt generally follow a standard procedure. This first this to do is find the
third party plugin that you'd like to use by finding it on the Grunt plugin [page](https://gruntjs.com/plugins).
When you find the plugin required, the details page of that plugin usually gives all the details needed to install
and use that plugin. The steps are usually as follows (We'll be using the testing plugin `grunt-contrib-nodeunit`)

1. Install the plugin in your project folder

        npm install grunt-contrib-nodeunit --save-dev
    
2. Load the plugin in Gruntfile.js. Add the following code to that file. 

        grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-nodeunit');
    
3. Configure the plugin. The plugin details page gives the various ways in which the plugin can be configured. Select your preference and add it to the config section 
of your Gruntfile.js

        grunt.initConfig({
          nodeunit: {
            all: ['test/*_test.js']
          }
        });
    
The above configuration ensures that all files in the 'test' directory with and extension of
`_test.js` is run. 

And that's the basic procedure for installing and using third party extension tasks using grunt. 


#####Describe with an example how to run grunt in watch mode where changes to a file re-runs tasks.

The grunt watch functionality is implemented using this plugin `grunt-contrib-watch` and allows for the automatic running of tasks
whenever files within the project are updated. 

After installing this plugin, you'll need to configure it so you can specify the files you want monitored. 
This is important because you wouldn't want to reload something like all your projects images every time you make a file change.
Let's look at a simple configuration for the grunt watch setup that will reload the project when changes are made to JS files - 

        grunt.initConfig({
          watch: {
            files: ['js/*.js'],
            tasks: ['jshint'],
          },
        });
        
With this simple setup, every time a JS file is updated in the JS directory, the `jshint` task will be run. Of course the configurations can get a 
lot more complex than this (See details [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-watch)) however 
this is a good starting point for anyone just getting familiar with watch mode using grunt. 

#####Explain with an example how to run gulp in watch mode where changes to a file re-runs tasks (you may need to look at the gulp documentation).

To run gulp in watch mode, you need to configure the tasks that need to be run with the built in `watch` command.

To get this done, you need to configure a task that you want run whenever a file is updated. Let's make a task for JS files.
    
    //Gulp task
    //Does something for JS files
    gulp.task('scripts', function(){
      console.log('Run scripts.');
    });
    
This is just a quick example but we basically want to run a task when JS files are changed.
Our simple function just logs a message but in a real development environment, we could minify the JS files
or maybe run a linter on them to ensure correct syntax. 

Let's set up a watcher for this task.

    //Gulp watcher
    gulp.task('watch', function(){
       gulp.watch('js/*.js', ['scripts']);
    });
    
The above code states that any time a `.js` file is changed in the js directory, we run the `scripts`
task. Notice that the `scripts` task is in an array, this means that we can add more tasks to be run 
when a JS file changes. 

To bring this all together, we simply run `gulp watch` on the command line and anytime a js file is changed
it will run the `scripts` task. 



#####Explain how the jQuery methods `closest` and `parents` work. Use code samples to demonstrate their usage and show the differences between them.

`.closest()`

* Begins with the current element
* Travels up the DOM tree until it finds a match for the supplied selector
* The returned jQuery object contains zero or one element for each element in the original set

Example code: `$('#item').closest('li);`

`.parent()`

* Begins with the parent element
* Travels up the DOM tree to the documentâ€™s root element, adding each ancestor element to a temporary collection; it then filters that collection based on a selector if one is supplied
* The returned jQuery object contains zero or more elements for each element in the original set

Example code: `$('#item').parents('li).first();`

#####Describe what templating is and explain its usefulness in frontend development.
Category: Introduction to Templating

Templating is a way to write HTML pages so that can be updated dynamically. It is great for
separating markup and logic on a web page (or view) and makes the code very maintainable and reuseable.
The syntax for most templating engines is close to HTML and generally just adds a few additional characters
that provide some awesome functions. 

Many web applications today require bits and pieces to be changed on the fly. Let's look at a simple example of 
a template based web page to see how it works. 

    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{post}}</h1>
    
Now image we had this data for our page. 

    var topStory = {
        "title": "Story",
        "post": "lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor."
    }
    
We can see that our HTML page has a few placeholders for data to come.
If we run the templating code, the HTML page will look like this. 

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor. lorem ipsum dolor.</h1>
    
Simple right? And even better, if we want to update this post, we only need to change the data in the `topStory` object.
This is what we mean by separating markup from application logic. The HTML remains untouched. Templating can be used in much more complex
ways to get even more cool features like running a `for` loop to spit out all the items in a list with one line of code,
but we'll save all that for later. 

For now, it should suffice to remember that templating makes your code easier to maintain and reuse by separating markup and application
logic.
