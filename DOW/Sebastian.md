Even though  Sebastian was born in London, he is a proud New Yorker, having lived there (in New York) from a very early age. Sebastian is a young, aspiring front-end developer who puts 200% into any goal he sets out to achieve. His determination, his strong will and his work ethic have all helped him to overcome some tough challenges and currently still drive him to pursue a career that he’s truly passionate about. Outside of front-end development, Sebastian loves travelling, photography, cooking, exercising and running. He also describes himself as an avid skier.

###The Journey 

Sebastian was born to a British father and American mother in London. Their unfortunate divorce when he was very young, led to Sebastian and his brother being raised by a single mother in the suburbs north of New York city. His mother is hard working, and has always been (and continues to be) very supportive of him and his brother throughout their lives. Needless to say, they love her very much.

 Sebastian has always been driven to succeed, but we all know that success isn’t usually handed to you on a silver platter. There are always challenges to overcome, twists and turns in the road and tough decisions that must be made before one can be considered successful. 

Without even realizing it, Sebastian began to overcome challenges by the age of 9 when he was diagnosed with ADHD. 
 ADHD is a chronic condition marked by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and sometimes impulsivity. ADHD begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood.

This condition made it hard for Sebastian to do any task that required a sustained period of concentration and as a result, Sebastian’s performance at school began to suffer. But that didn’t stop him. With the support of his mother and a strong determination to overcome this hurdle, he attended a special school for students with learning disabilities and learned how to cope with the condition. After attending this school he knew that he had become a better, more efficient learner. Through all this, Sebastian remembers his love for computers - 

“I’ve loved computers ever since I was a child” says Sebastian, “I would play around on my family's antique Mac Classic and thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen.”

Sebastian’s younger years were spent in New York, but the family decided to move to  a town called Carbondale in the mountains of Colorado, where he and his brother finished high school.

“Growing up, my family kept hundreds of volumes of old National Geographic magazines in our home, and I would read them and watch National Geographic wildlife videos avidly. I became incredibly interested in travel and wildlife, and wanted to someday travel the world as a photographer, taking pictures of cool animals and places.”

 Living in Colorado fueled Sebastian’s love for travel and photography. It’s natural beauty viciously attacked his heart, causing him to instantly fall in love with the scenery and wildlife of the rockies. Sebastian continues to love nature and travelling to this day; most of all, he loves taking pictures everywhere he goes.

Sebastian studied hard while attending school in Colorado and his hard work paid off. He was accepted into Dartmouth College (a very selective, Ivy League school ) and describes it as one of his greatest achievements. Even though he loved  computers, life had different plans for Sebastian and he ended up studying Economics, Government and Arabic while attending Dartmouth. He was even lucky enough to be able to study abroad in both Mexico and Morocco which only increased  his love for travel. Sebastian saw a bit of the world while in college and this undoubtedly opened his eyes to new cultures and experiences.

Even though Sebastian’s choice of study had taken a turn away from computers, he remembers still liking to use them. He worked at a computer help desk in college and would always help the less tech savvy members of his family  to set up their internet systems and ensure that everything worked as expected. 

After college, Sebastian selected to work at an Investment Bank in New York. After a year and a half at the bank, Sebastian realized that he neither liked the work, nor the culture  and left the job. This bold move caused him to experience one of the most challenging times in his life. He was unemployed for nine months, and not only that, he needed to figure out a whole new career path for himself. He ran out of money quite often and had to rely on part-time jobs and support from his friends while getting his life together. 

Luckily,  though they were skeptical about hiring him because he had no programming background, he landed a position at a small (London-based) software company called Afinium which he interned for during college. Afinium develops Content Management Systems (CMS) for large insurance companies and it was at this job where his love for computers finally started catching back up to him and he got his first taste of web development and programming. Even though he was hired as a business analyst, he was fascinated by the company’s software development skills and yearned for knowledge on how the software worked and how it was built. As with everything else he does Sebastian put in 200% effort at Afinium so he could prove to them that he was right for the job. It as this job that persuaded Sebastian to pursue a career in web development. 

He was always thirsty for knowledge so the company paid for him to take some basic front end development classes online and he did a lot of self teaching. After this he was able to help build some front end UIs for Afinium and he even did a few projects for some clients.

[Example Project Two](https://162.218.137.98/index.php?ProductID=1802)

He loved the work and describes it as a great feeling - he’d finally found something that he truly enjoyed.
Afinium was doing well and often looked like it was going to become a giant in the software development industry.. In the fall of 2015 however, one of their key clients fell off and due to dwindling revenue and work volume, Afinium downsized its entire US team and Sebastian was left without a job. 

“Which sucked” 

A month later the Modern Developer program started. 

###Current Location

Sebastian currently resides in New York with his girlfriend. He has grown to really love front end web development and is fully committed to making it his lifelong career. He has decided to take on Modern Developer full time while tutoring high schoolers in Math for American college-entrants tests to pay the bills. He describes his current situation as “a little tough” because the MD program is taking quite a bit longer than anyone expected, and he is eager to start looking for work in the tech industry. Right now he has to balance both Modern Developer and income-generating work and is concerned about making all the ends meet during the remainder of the Modern Developer program.

“I need to ensure that I can support myself until graduation, and as of right now nobody really knows when that’ll be” he says.

###The Road Ahead
Sebastian plans to continue to work hard and stay focused - confident that he’ll land a fulfilling job once the Modern Developer program is complete. He wants to work for a larger company as opposed to a startup again and influenced by his love for travel and tech, he says that his dream job is to work for Google Maps which combines the best of both worlds!

Sebastian plans to enjoy his career and his life outside of work. He has really taken an interest in running - having completed three half marathons - and aims to finish a full marathon someday soon. He’ll continue doing the things he loves with his  family and his awesome group of friends.

We definitely wish him well and support him in achieving all the success that he aims for in life.
