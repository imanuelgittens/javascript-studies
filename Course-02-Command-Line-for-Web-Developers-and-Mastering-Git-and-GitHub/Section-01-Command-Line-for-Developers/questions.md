####Question 1

*Write an introduction to the topic, the command line. Explain the purpose of the command line and the benefits of using it. Also list careers in which a person may use the command line for common tasks. Add any details you considered important as you learned the command line.*

The command line...a vague and cryptic legend of the past? Or a powerful tool for its users today. The command line is a simple and quite minimalistic tool for interacting with the files, folders and features of your computer. Many PC users today have become accustomed to interacting with their machine through the GUI or Graphic User Interface (the ability to point and click with your mouse). The command line however, is totally different, it allows its users to interact with their computer through the CLI or Command Line interface. It should be noted that the CLI can do everything that the GUI can do (and perhaps more) but the way in which it works can make it seem a bit daunting. Here is an example of the Command Line Interface.

That's it, a simple screen that allows you to type a command and hit the **Enter** key. How in the world is this useful? Well, after you overcome the first and most difficult hurdle of using the command line, you will find the experience quite pleasant. This hurdle is learning the commands. There are many commands that allow the user to do many different things. Learning them will take some time but once you learn the core set of commands, everything else is easily understood. 

The command line gives its users a faster and more powerful way to interact with their computer. How so? Well typing a command it often faster than looking for a desktop icon and clicking it. There are also several commands that can be implemented using the command line quite quickly as opposed to their GUI counterparts. One such command would be to change the permissions on a file or folder. The command line really enables you to become a *power user* of you machine and a true master of your computing environment. 

There are also some careers that require you to use the command line quite often. So no matter how much you fear that blank screen with a blinking cursor, if you want to work in any of these feels, you would need to quickly overcome these fears -

- Web Developer
- Application Developer
- Game Developer

Or any other Career that requires programming. 

Learning the command line can seem hard at first. It is also more complex considering that the command line is different on Windows as opposed to Mac and Linux. In order to make the learning process a bit easier, I would suggest that you learn the command line on Mac or Linux. If you have a windows computer is it quite easy to install Linux using a program like [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). The reason for this suggestion is because it is easier to work with the command line on these operating systems and there is a lot more documentation online that can help if you have a problem. Learn and practice a few commands every day until your comfortable with them. Keep practicing and using the command line for everything that you can. Do this and you'll be well on you way to becoming the next best programmer in your field. 

####Question 2

*Explain the function of the `man` command. Be certain to include at least two usage and syntax examples of the command.*

The `man` command is used to display a "manual page" for another command listed after it. Here is an example of its usage -

	man ls

Here, this command will show the manual page for the `ls` command.
