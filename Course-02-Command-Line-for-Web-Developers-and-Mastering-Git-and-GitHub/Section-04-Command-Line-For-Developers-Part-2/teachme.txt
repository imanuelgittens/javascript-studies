PWD

Syntax
To use this command, type the letters `pwd` into your command prompt and hit [Enter]. 


Important Flags

-L - example usage `pwd -L`

-P - example usage `pwd -P`
This flag displays ALL the links to the present directory location. For example if we have a directory 

	/home/projects 

but its full link is 

	/var/www/root/projects

then when we use the `-P` flag, the full link will be displayed to the screen.
