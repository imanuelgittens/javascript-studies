####Thoroughly explain `git diff`, and it's importance. Describe `git diff` in a thoughtful way, so that a teenager could understand it and provide examples of it's usage.

#Comparing project versions with `git diff`

Suppose you are working on a big project and you suddenly come across an error that you just quite seem to figure out how to fix. You figure that it would be best to retrace your steps because just last week, everything worked fine! However, the question remains - how do I see the differences in my project between this week and last week? 

`git diff` to the rescue. This is an incredibly powerful command allows you to see the differences between any two points in your project history. You (our developer) can now see exactly what changed between this week and the last, allowing you to  fast-track the process of figuring out what change may have introduced the error.
