cd

Example usage

The most common way to use the `cd` command is as follows

	cd path/to/directory

Example 1:

Let us assume that we are in the root directory of our filesystem denoted by `/`. We want to navigate to the home directory where we saved our files. The home directory is one level down from our root directory so to get there we 
need to type 

	cd home

If we now wished to access the `Pictures` directory (which is one level down from our `home` directory), we need to type

	cd Pictures

Examples 2:

We can access any directory on the filesystem by typing the `cd` command, followed by the full path to the desired folder. We could also go straight to the `Pictures` directory from our root directory (`/`) by typing

	cd home/Pictures



ls

Description

The `ls` command displays an alphabetically ordered list of the files and folders in the current directory and information about those files and folders. 

When used with any of its many flags, the `ls` command can be made to filter and sort the results it displays based on a variety of criteria.
