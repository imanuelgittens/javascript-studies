####Question 1

**Describe what style inheritance is and use examples to fully describe how it works.**

Inheritance in CSS is easily understandable if we compare it to inheritance in genetics. Consider a mother and child both have brown hair and blue eyes. In the same way, a parent element and its child element in HTML will have the same font family.
