####Exercise 1

1)

In a routerless network -

	n = 100
	K(n) = n(n-1)/2
	     = 100(99)/2
	     = 4950

So we would need 4950 cables to make up a complete routerless network. 

Creating the same network with a single router as a hub would require 100 cables since each 
computer would just need to be connected to the router. 

2)

For this use case, a circuit switching network would be the best solution. This application requires reliability (provided by circuit switching networks) since the data needs to be sent to the server at a very specific rate. The application also needs to be uninterrupted for days at a time and this further solidifies the need for a reliable connection. 

3)

The packet switching network would be best used for this application since it does not require a high level of reliability. Data is sent in small chunks and its delivery is not time sensitive which means that the data can split up, sent on the network, and reassembled without worrying about the length of time taken.
