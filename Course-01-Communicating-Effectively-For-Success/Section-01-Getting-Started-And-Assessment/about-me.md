####Introduction
---
 Hello everyone! My name is **Imanuel**. I'm a 26 year old web developer living and working in Trinidad and Tobago (*that's in the Caribbean for those who don't know*). I've completed my BSc. Degree in Information Technology at the University of the West indies and I've been working at my current web development job for just over 2 years.

####My First Encounter With Programming?
---
Hmmm...That was a long time ago. My mother did her degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering back in the days of DOS so I basically grew up around computer programming. I think the very first '*code*' that wrote was when I was 13 or 14 years old in Microsoft Excel '97. Something random like =SUM(A1:A4). 

I didn't think much of it back then but maybe that really was the first seed being planted, influencing where my career has taken me so far. I hadn't really given it much thought before writing this piece. 

####Career Path and Plans
---
Honestly I chose my current path (*Career Path 3 and 5*) because I'm thirsty for knowledge. What ever I do, I like to be the best at it so the more I learn, the better off I'll be. 

I would also like to help my peers and co-workers to learn to program. The education we receive here doesn't really prepare you for the real world of web development so I decided to take the task upon myself to learn well and help others along the way.

####Goals
---
My goals related to web programming are as follows:

- Learn to program well.
- Help my peers along the way.
- Using our combined education, pave the way for better technologies and greater technology adoption in the Caribbean where it's development and use is greatly lacking. 

Modern Developer gets me started on this journey by helping me to learn programming well. 


####Demonstrating Perseverance
---
The most recent instance in which I demonstrated perseverance was on a project at my job. We built a solution for a client using code that worked in IE9 forward, only to find out that the client needed the solution to work in IE8. Needless to say this was a very frustrating experience. Even though I wasn't doing all the coding, I did just as much work researching why things weren't working and suggesting ways to fix them (a lot of 12-14 hour work days). In the end we managed to pull through, fixing things enough to get a working solution in IE8. 

####What I Do For Fun

These are some of the things I like doing in my free time:

1. Play video games
2. Hang out with friends (or as we say in Trinidad - "*Liming*")
3. Exercise! I'm always training in some form or fashion.
4. Hiking and hitting the beach (out door stuff in general).

####Life in Trinidad and Tobago
---
Trinidad and Toabgo is a twin island Republic in the Caribbean. I live in Trinidad. 

>Life here is a mix between Quiet Island Life and Non Stop Partying!

It is festive and we have a very laid back culture. We have people of all races who love to party and have a good time. (*A  lot of people go way overboard with the partying. lol*). Our annual Carnival attracts thousands of visitors every year - it's the biggest carnival in the Caribbean and the self proclaimed "Greatest Show on Earth". 
We have beautiful beaches and there is a ferry that transports you across to Tobago that has even better beaches than Trinidad. Since their is so much mixture between races and cultures, we also get to enjoy food from all over the world right here. :)

>Of course with good also comes bad. 

If you work in the Captial city, (*I work in the Capital*) transport to get in and out sucks! We have a lot of traffic. We also have concerns about a growing crime rate and a government that doesn't really do much to help the citizens. There is also the reality that opportunity isn't based on merit but on connections ('who you know'). 

All in all, I love Trinidad. I enjoy the culture and I just plan on tackling the bad parts head on by creating my own opportunities instead of relying on others.

####Most Enjoyable Experience
---
About 4 years ago we were just having a regular old boring Sunday until we couldn't take it any more. Me, my brother and a few of my friends just randomly got together, bought some bottles of rum, and decided to go to the river to *lime* (liming is the term we use for any social gathering). We didn't go to any of the rivers near our houses, we decided to run through a mountain trail to get to a river that was very far from where we live. 
It was one of the most random and best experiences I ever had. We live close to the top of a small mountain in Trinidad so we ran down the slope on the dirt path, dodging branches, holes, bees and whatever else nature threw at us. When we go to the bottom, we had to walk a good distance on a regular road. We drank, got tipsy, sang songs and stopped at random shops to buy snacks and play pool (*billiards*). 
When we got to the river their was about 150 other people there. A lot of them were very friendly and invited us to eat from the fireside food they made (Cooking by the river is very common in Trinidad). There was also music playing from people's cars, adding to the festive atmosphere. 
When we got to the river we had diving competitions and competitions to see who could jump into the river from the highest point on the adjacent hill. 
After all this, we left the river way too late and had to run back up the mountain dirt path at night with not even the moon to help us see. We scrambled back up the hill using our cell phones screens as lights. After much struggle we all got home and I slept like a baby. :)

####Immediate Travel Destination? 
---
If I had to choose somewhere to go right now it would be Canada. Seeing snow is one of the top things on my bucket list. I want to ski, snowboard and ice skate. When i'm done, I must have falled down so many times that I never want to see snow again. I would also love to see Naiagra Falls. :)
