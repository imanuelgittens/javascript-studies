*To*: **Manager - More Vino Restaurant**

I hope this letter meets you in good cheer as we celebrate the Christmas season. With 2016 fast approaching, I wish all blessings to you and your loved ones. I also wish you a bright and prosperous new year. 

I am reaching out because I want us to make 2016 a better year, not only for ourselves, but for others. Considering that it is the Christmas season, I think now is a great time to do something (however small) that can have a positive effect on others.  

It occured to me that your Restaurant may have leftover or unspoiled food at the end of the day that is just thrown out. If this is indeed true, I was wondering if you would be interested in partnering with a local charitable organization to pick up any excess food you have to provide for the less fortunate. 

Coming from an impoverished household myself when I was growing up, I know that anything extra goes a long way - this is why, while writing this letter, the first organization that came to mind was the Gift for Life Foundation. They are an awesome charitable organization that helps to provide for underpriviledged children in homes throughout Trinidad and Tobago. I'm sure a representative of this organization would be more than willing and very eager to partner with you to provide food for the nations' kids. 

If you are interested and would like help to set up a meeting, I would be more than willing to contact them on your behalf and facilitate. I look forward to your response.  



*All the best to you and yours*
