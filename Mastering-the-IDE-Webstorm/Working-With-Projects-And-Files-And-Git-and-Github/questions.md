####Question 1

Outline the system requirements for operating WebStorm on a computer, then describe in detail how to download and install WebStorm on the operating system you are using (use screenshots).

For Webstorm to work properly after it is installed your computer will need -

- At least 1 GB of RAM although 2 GB is recommended
- A screen resolution no less than 1024x768

Once these minimum requirements are met, you can install Webstorm by -

- Downloading the WebStorm setup file from the [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/) page. It automatically selects the correct version based on your operating system.

- We will be installing Webstorm on the Ubuntu operating system so after clicking downloading, you should see a file called Webstorm-[some-number].tar.gz in your downloads folder.

- Right click on this file then click 'Extract here' and a folder will be created named - Webstorm-[some-numer]

- Within this newly created Webstorm folder, there is a sub-folder call - bin. You need to open your terminal and navigate to this bin folder. An easy way to do this is to open your terminal, type `cd` followed by a space and then drag the bin folder into the terminal. This will copy the folder path into the terminal afterwhich you can just hit **Enter**.
- After navigating to the bin folder type `WebStorm.sh` and the install process will begin.

And that's it! Once you go through all the steps of the install process, Webstorm will now be available for use on your linux devices. 

Congratulations!
