####Question 1
Title: WebStorm Code Completion

Category: Why You Need WebStorm and How to Get and Install It

Webstorm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is built specifically for web development and it comes packed
with powerful features that take its functionality far beyond the level of most code editors. While there are many other
IDEs that compete with Webstorm in the web development world, a unique feature makes it stand out among the rest. That
feature is called *intelligent code completion* and it really pushes the envelop by speeding up the time it takes to
write programs in a smart and unintrusive way.

While many rival IDEs and text editors have the ability to make code suggestions either through plugin or out of
the box, Webstorm's intelligent code completion actually analyzes the context of code being written and uses this to
make suggestions. This way Webstorm only makes suggestions that help you only within the context of your work and
this allows the developer to work faster and smarter.

This unique feature added to the numerous other benefits that Webstorm provides makes it arguably the best IDE for
web development.

Webstorm plugins are bits of software that can be installed to extend/expand the functionality of your IDE. Some of the
advantages of plugins include:
- extensibility: the application can be dynamically extended to include new features.
- parallel development: feautures can be implemented as seperate components, by different teams at the same time.
- simplicity: a plugin typically has one function, and so developers have a single focus.
