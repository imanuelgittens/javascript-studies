#### Exercise 1

**Question 1.**

A = {1,2,4,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
B = {1,3,6,9,12,15,18}
C = {1,5,10,15,20}

	|A u B| = |A| + |B| - |A n B|

	= 10 + 7 -3
	= 17 - 3
	= 14

---
	|B u C| = |B| + |C| - |B n C|

	= 7 + 5 -2
	= 12 - 2
	=10

---
	|A u C| = |A| + |C| - |A n C|
	= 10 + 5 -3
	= 15  - 3
	= 12

---
	|A u B u C| = |A| = |B| + |C| - |A n B| - |B n C| - |A n C| + |A n B n C|

	= 10 + 7 + 5 -3 -2 -3 +1
	= 22 _ 8 +1
	=15

---
**Question 2**
	|S| = 18
	|F| = 20
	|B| = 12

	|F n B| = 4
	|S n B| = 3
	|S n F| = 2
	|S n F n B| = 1

	|S u F u B| = |S| + |F| + |B| - |F n B| - |S n B| - |S n F| + |S n F n B|
	= 18 + 20 + 12 - 4 - 3 - 2 + 1
	= 42


#### Exercise 2

**Question 1**

C (n,k) = n!/k!(n-k)!

C(12,5) = 12!/5!(12-5)!
= 12!/5!*7!
=792


**Question2**

There are 10 ways (10 choose 1) to pick a book from each category. There are 10 categories to choose from. This means that there are 

	10^10

ways to recommend and order 10 books to a new user. 

#### Exercise 3

**Question 1**

There are 365 days in a year so in order to ensure that at least two people in the room share a birthday, 

we would need to have a room with at least 366 people. 

**Question 2**

a)

F(0) = 0

F(1) = 1

F(2) = 1

F(3) = 2

F(4) = 3

F(5) = 5

b) This is the Fibonacci sequence.
