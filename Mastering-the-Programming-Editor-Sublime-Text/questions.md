Title: Sublime Text Innovations
Category: Why You Need Sublime Text

Sublime Text is one of the best text editors for writing code, markup and prose. Its users enjoy a simple, aesthetic interface that packs extraordinary features and amazing performance under the hood. Sublime text stands out among other text editors because of these extrardinary features - features that this editor can boast of being the first to implement. Some of these features include:

- Multiple selections - This allows you to edit different parts of text at the same time.
- Goto Anything interface - This allows you to open files, jump to symbols, lines and words with only a few keystrokes.
- Command Palette - This simplifies access to common commands.

Sublime Text joins these innovations with a host of other design and functionality choices that truly make it one of the best text editors around. If you're looking to start programming and you aren't sure which editor to use, be sure to give Sublime Text a test run and see for yourself. 

Happy coding!

Title: Text Editors in Programming
Category: Why You Need Sublime Text

As a programmer, you need a tool to get your job done, and that tool, is your editor. Your choice of editors can directly affect your experiences, workflows and capabilities therefore choosing a good one to work with is very important. Programming editors come in the form of both IDEs (integrated Development Environments) and Text Editors but this article will pay particular attention to the Text Editor and describe its important to programming. 



In contrast, while text editors give up many of the IDEs integrated features, they are lighter, faster programs and provide a streamlined editing experience. Using a text editor is a more do-it-yourself approach, where you add features as you need them.

As usual, there are trade-offs with both technologies, but both IDEs and text editors can help you be more productive if you learn them well. The newest programming editors, such as Atom and VS Code, try to strike a balance between the two worlds, leaning towards the simplicity of text editors, while including enough extensibility options (more than earlier text editors) to compose a fully featured IDE out of various parts implemented as plugins.

In summary, IDEs tend to be more monolithic, text editors more modular. However, thanks to plugins, you can achieve a hybrid experience. Both IDEs and text editors frequently support plugins, add-ons, and extensions that add new features. For example, a text editor may gain IDE-like functionality (such as smart auto-completion or live error checking) through a plugin. However, such additions frequently come at the cost of increased complexity or reduced performance.
